# ddos-attack-detection-using-machine-learning
Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is the most dangerous attack in the field of network security. DDoS attack halts normal functionality of critical services of various online applications. Systems under DDoS attacks remain busy with false requests (Bots) rather than providing services to legitimate users. These attacks are increasing day by day and have become more and more sophisticated. So, it has become difficult to detect these attacks and secure online services from these attacks. In this project, we have used machine learning based approach to detect and classify different types of network traffic flows.
